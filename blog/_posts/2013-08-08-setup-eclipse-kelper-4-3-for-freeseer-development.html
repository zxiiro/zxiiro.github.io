Freeseer is mainly coded in Python so you will need to install the pydev package for Eclipse. Personally I would recommend downloading the Eclipse Standard package from: 

    http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Once downloaded extract it somewhere and launch it.

The first thing you will want to do is install

Development

- pydev

- github connector

- mylyn

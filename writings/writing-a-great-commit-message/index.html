<h1>Writing a great commit message<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-a-great-commit-message" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>An often overlooked part of Git is the commit message. The usefulness of many
of Git’s features rely on well structured commit messages.</p>
<p>A commit message structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Subject line in 50 chars or less

Following a blank line after the subject line is the commit message
body, containing a more detailed explaination of the change.
This should be word-wrapped at 72 characters.

The body can consist of as many lines as necessary to fully
explain in detail why the change is necessary. You should
explain the problem that this commit is solving and focus on
why this change is necessary rather than explaining the &quot;how&quot;
(the reviewer can review the code for that detail).

Include any side effects and consequences of the change.

Many CLI based tools such as `git log`, `git shortlog`,
`git rebase`, are significantly more useful when the commit
messages follow these best practices.

Finally the last &quot;block&quot; (a section without further blank lines
following it) is for metadata such as sign-offs, references, and
issue numbers.

</div>
<p>We will break down the major sections below.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-subject-line">
<h2>The subject line<a class="headerlink" href="#the-subject-line" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The subject line should be short and sweet, providing enough detail for the
reader to immediately have a decent idea about what the commit is about.</p>
<p>From the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> manpage:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change,
followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up
to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit
title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example,
Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on
the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keep the subject line short (50 characters)</p></li>
<li><p>The first letter of the subject line should be capitalized</p></li>
<li><p>The subject line should not end with any punctuation</p></li>
<li><p>The subject line should be written in imperative mood</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately following subject line is a blank line</p></li>
<li><p>Descriptive enough that one can get the gist of the change</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="text-success">Allow pyyaml >= 5</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-success">Bump version to 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-success">Fix double inderection of name templates</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-success">Add Private and WIP change support for Gerrit</p></li>
</ul><p><strong>Bad examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p class="text-danger">Fix build issue</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-danger">Fixes delete-all command when no option is provided.</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-danger">Adding view for the Delivery Pipeline Plugin</p></li>
  <li><p class="text-danger">test non-default value of attach-build-log</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section" id="the-commit-body">
<h2>The commit body<a class="headerlink" href="#the-commit-body" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Following a blank line after the subject line, the commit body is where you
can explain your change in full details.</p>
<p><strong>Best practices:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keep lines under 72 characters</p></li>
<li><p>Explain what and why instead of how</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Git as well many tools that parse Git commits do not automatically wrap text
so you must manually do this yourself. Keeping the limit to 72 characters is
good practice to allow for Git to do indentation and still be under 80
characters total.</p>
<p>Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewer of the change. If someone proposed
this change to you, what information would you like to know about it before
you will approve the change?</p>
<p>Reviewers can look at the diff to see what exactly was changed so focus on
telling the reviewer why they should accept your change. You are essentially
writing a project proposal here so provide as much detail as possible.</p>
<p>If you are fixing code or a test, include details on how to reproduce the
problem so that the reviewer doesn’t have to reach out to you for further
details on how to retest.</p>
<p><strong>Good example A:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Fix the yaml load warning

In the new version of PyYAML the API changed to be more explicit. Now
the default value for the Loader is None, see:

https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/blob/5.1/lib3/yaml/__init__.py#L103

The load is unsafe. It&#39;s better to use safe_load function.

<p><strong>Good example B:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Add &#39;secret-token&#39; parameter to gitlab trigger

This adds support for the job specific secret token in the
gitlab build trigger.

This feature was added to the &quot;Gitlab Plugin&quot; with version 1.4.1
(released Sep 24, 2016).
Excerpt from the changelog:
 &quot;Add possiblity to configure secret tokens per job to allow
 only web hooks with the correct token to trigger builds.&quot;

<div class="section" id="commit-message-trailer">
<h2>Commit message trailer<a class="headerlink" href="#commit-message-trailer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final block of a commit message is for trailers. Similar to email it is
where you sign off on your message as well as include other useful metadata.
Typically for references to issues or links to pages for additional
information.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use the form <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Key:</span> <span class="pre">Value</span></code> when entering trailers</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the last block has no blank lines in between entries</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a relevant issue, refer to it here</p></li>
<li><p>Give credit via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Co-authored-by</span></code> to other folks who worked on this commit</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Issue: ABC-123

</div>
<p><strong>Signed-off-by</strong></p>
<p>In some open source projects folks leave a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Signed-off-by:</span> <span class="pre">Firstname</span> <span class="pre">Lastname</span> <span class="pre">&lt;someone&#64;example.com&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p>This can be added automatically via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span> <span class="pre">-s</span></code> command, it’s a
convenience parameter but you can also type it in by hand when writing your
commit message.</p>
<p>Signed-off-by doesn’t really mean much in most projects but some open source
projects use it as a way of indicating that you have signed off on an
official document such as a <strong>Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</strong> or a
<strong>Developer Certificate of Origin</strong>.</p>

<p>While it may seem handy, it promotes a bad habit of writing unthoughtful

spend more time thinking about your commit message, often producing higher
quality messages.</p>

<li><p><strong>Spend time reviewing code yourself</strong></p>
<p>If you are actively participating in a project, spend some time reviewing
code on that project even if you are not a maintainer or committer on the
project. This is the best way for you to quickly learn the best practices of
not only the project but also what we discussed here as it is easier to
understand the hardships of a code reviewer if you are one yourself.</p>

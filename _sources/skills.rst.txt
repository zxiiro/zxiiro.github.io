Core to my automation toolbox, I write bash scripts to automate builds and
release management processes.

Git

Git is my favourite version control system and have been using it extensively
in Open Source projects since 2008. I am familair with using some of git's more
advanced features such as bisect, format-patch, submodule, and rebase.

first year in University.

Jenkins Job Builder
-------------------

I have been a maintainer of the Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) tool since 2015. I
use this tool in Jenkins based projects to manage job configuration as code.

Travis CI

Technical Writing
=================

I have been writing and maintaining technical documentation for Open Source
projects since 2008 both as an individual contributor as well as part of a team
of docs writers. Duties include:

* Organizing and running docs team meetings
* Reviewing documentation contributions
* Writing technical documentation

Sphinx

I have bootstrapped and / or maintain several Sphinx based documentation
projects for Organizations and Open Source projects. Sphinx has been a great
asset in my docs toolbox for writing both API docs as well as End User
documentation.

I have maintained documentation for Open Source projects such as:

* `Freeseer <https://freeseer.readthedocs.io/>`_
* `OpenDaylight <http://docs.opendaylight.org>`_
* `Linux Foundation Release Engineering <http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org>`_

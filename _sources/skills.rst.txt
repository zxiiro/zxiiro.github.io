Software
========

Bash
----

Core to my automation toolbox, I write bash scripts to automate builds and
release management processes.

Gerrit
------

I have been using Gerrit since 2008 for many Open Source projects. I also
manage several Gerrit servers for several Open Source communities. Gerrit is a
great tool for a code review first workflow to ensure developers review code
before merging the work into the production system.

Git
---

Git is my favourite version control system and have been using it extensively
in Open Source projects since 2008. I am familair with using some of git's more
advanced features such as bisect, format-patch, submodule, and rebase.

Linux
-----

Linux is my Operating System of choice and have been using it since 2003, my
first year in University.

Maven
-----

Nexus Repository
----------------

Python
------

I have been writing software with Python since 2008. Initially for the Freeseer
project while I was volunteering my time at :ref:`FOSSLC <fosslc>`.


Release Engineering
===================

Jenkins
-------

Jenkins Job Builder
-------------------

I am an active maintainer of the Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) tool since 2015. I
deploy this tool in all projects that use Jenkins CI to manage job
configuration as code.

Travis CI
---------

Technical Writing
=================

I have been writing and maintaining technical documentation for Open Source
projects since 2008 both as an individual contributor as well as part of a team
of docs writers. Duties include:

* Organizing and running docs team meetings
* Reviewing documentation contributions
* Writing technical documentation

Sphinx
------

I have bootstrapped and / or maintain several Sphinx based documentation
projects for Organizations and Open Source projects. Sphinx has been a great
asset in my docs toolbox for writing both API docs as well as End User
documentation.

I have maintained documentation for Open Source projects such as:

* `Freeseer <https://freeseer.readthedocs.io/>`_
* `OpenDaylight <http://docs.opendaylight.org>`_
* `Linux Foundation Release Engineering <http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org>`_

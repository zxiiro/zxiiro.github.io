Technical Writing
=================

I have been writing and maintaining technical documentation for Open Source
projects since 2008 both as an individual contributor as well as part of a team
of docs writers. Duties including:

* Organizing and running docs team meetings
* Reviewing documentation contributions
* Writing technical documentation

Sphinx
------

I have bootstrapped and / or maintain several Sphinx based documentation
projects for Organizations and Open Source projects. Sphinx has been a great
asset in my docs toolbox for writing both API docs as well as End User
documentation.

I have maintained documentation for Open Source projects such as:

* `Freeseer <https://freeseer.readthedocs.io/`_
* `OpenDaylight <http://docs.opendaylight.org>`_
* `Linux Foundation Release Engineering <http://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org>`_

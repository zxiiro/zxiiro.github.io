I am an open source developer specializing in DevOps best practices, release
engineering, and workflow automation. I enjoy working on projects where my
skills will have a meaningful impact and am not afraid of learning new skills
and technologies.

I have helped projects small and large scale their build infrastructure
supporting over 10k build jobs deployed to CI across multiple systems and
projects in a global environment. I support engineering teams by optimizing and
automating workflows so that developers can focus on what they do best. I
support developers as a point of knowledge for technologies such as Git, CI
systems, and tooling.

My DevOps journey began at the Eclipse Foundation where I lead an effort
convert the Eclipse Platform's outdated PDE build toolchain over to Maven. This
was a massive effort that ultimately enabled engineering teams around the world
to be able to successfully build the Eclipse Platform which until then was
tribal knowledge to a handful of organizations. I helped roll out and support
100s of project's build infrastructure through the initial implementation of
the Eclipse Common Build Infrastructure (CBI) utilizing Hudson CI and automated
deployment processes to manage and bootstrap Hudson Instance Per Project
(HIPP).

At the Linux Foundation, I helped the OpenDaylight (ODL) project roll out a CI
build infrastructure to support the 100+ ODL sub-projects. We utilized tools
like Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) to create job templates which were redeployable
to ODL Java projects and managed through a centralized Git repository allowing
new sub-projects to quickly bootstrap their code base. The infrastructure we
build in ODL ultimately became the standard infrastructure environment that the
Linux Foundation rolled out to later projects such as OPNFV, ONAP, O-RAN,
FD.io, HyperLedger, ASWF, and many more....

In addition to infrastructure I lead the software development of Linux
Foundation's RELENG toolchain including lftools, common-packer, global-jjb, and
common documentation efforts. These are reusable toolchains that the LF deploys
to project infrastructure that are supported by the LF release engineering
team. We focused on maintaining common best practices, reusability and regular
releases to support downstream projects using these tools.

In my role at Lumina Networks I managed the internal CI infrastructure on AWS
for the engineering team. I worked with engineering teams to plan and build out
infrastructure to support product roadmaps such as support for BlackDuck and
Kubernetes.
